Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end configuration of a Windows-based enterprise environment within a virtualized lab. The primary focus was implementing the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) through structured Organizational Units (OUs) and restrictive Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to minimize the internal attack surface.
This document covers:

Domain controller setup

DNS configuration

Active Directory structure (OUs, users, groups)

Security controls and least privilege implementation

Troubleshooting actions taken during deployment
